# Graph Learning Package(multiple graph PLS)

## Description
This document introduces basic usage of GLP package. The main components of this package are frequent subgraph pattern miner; gSpan and (multiple) graph PLS regression.

## Requirements
1. Cmake 2.6 or higher.  
2. Eigen 3.1.2 or higher.  
3. Boost 1.4.2 or higher.  
4. (optional) Open-babel

## Installation
### Linux
```bash
$ make  
$ make install
```

### Mac OS X (homebrew)
```bash
$ make  
$ make install
$ brew link glp
```

## Pre-processing
### Converting SDF/MOL-formatted file into gSpan-formatted file

```bash
$ cd data
$ python ../tools/sdf2gsp.py -f mutagen.sdf -l mutagen.label -o mutagen.gsp
```

### Create train/test dataset
In this example, we use 80% data for training, and the rest 20% data for test.

Generate train/test gsp data first,

```bash
$ python ../tools/mk_train_test.py -f mutagen.gsp -b mutagen -r 0.8
[INFO] total:  684
[INFO] Generating train data now: 547
[>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 100% >>>>>>>>>>>>>>]
[INFO] Generating test data now: 137
[>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 100% >>>>>>>>>>>>>>]
[INFO] All Done!
```

Then generate responses,

```bash
# single
$ head -547 mutagen.label > mutagen_train.label
$ tail -137 mutagen.label > mutagen_test.label

# multiple
$ head -547 Ymatrix.txt > mutagen_train_multiple.label
$ tail -137 Ymatrix.txt > mutagen_test_multiple.label
```

## gSpan; frequent subgraph pattern miner

An exemplar usage of mining frequent subgraph patterns from graph data

```bash
$ gspan -m 10 -L 10 mutagen.gsp
```
where `-m` specifies minimum support, and `-L` specifies maximum pattern size.

It produces three output files, and they are

- `gspan_m10_nINF_L10_DFS.txt`, which contains subgraph patterns in DFS format. For details about DFS format, please see APPENDIX.
- `gspan_m10_nINF_L10_Freq.txt`, which contains the frequencies of the enumerated subgraph patterns.
- `gspan_m10_nINF_L10_Features.txt` which contains binary occurrence matrix of the obtained subgraph patterns.

Type `gspan` to see more options.

## gPLS; (graph Partial Least Squares) regression
### gPLS Training

For performing gPLS with a single response label

```bash
$ gspls-train --cla -o 0 -n 10 -y mutagen_train.label mutagen_train.gsp
```

For performing gPLS with multiple response labels

```bash
$ gspls-train --cla -o 0 -n 10 \
  -y mutagen_train_multiple.label mutagen_train.gsp
```

where `--cla` speficies classfication mode. Default is regression mode `--reg`, and `-o` specifies the number of training data to be separated for validation (in order to choose the number of latent vectors), and `-n` specifies the maximum number of iterations,
and `-y` specifies the file with response values.

In multiple-PLS mode, the corresponding file should contain response matrix.  
It produces two output files, and they are

- `gspls_m2_L10_n10_k1_t3_DFS.txt`, which contains subgraph patterns in DFS format.
- `gspls_m2_L10_n10_k1_t3_Beta.txt`, which contains regression coefficients.

Type `gspls-train` to see more options.

### gPLS Test

```bash
$ gspls-classify --cla -d gspls_m2_L10_n10_k1_t3_DFS.txt \
  -b gspls_m2_L10_n10_k1_t3_Beta.txt -y mutagen_test.label mutagen_test.gsp
```

where `-b` specifies the file with learned regression weights, and
`-y` specifies the file with response values.

In multiple-PLS mode, the corresponding file contains response matrix.

Type `gspls-classify` to see more options.

## Visualization
__The scripts used here only works with Open-babel installed and need OS X environment__

One way to visualize obtained subgraph patterns is to first convert the obtained raw DFS files into SDF/MOL files. Then one can use chemical conversion software openbabel to generate PNG files.

```bash
$ mkdir -p sdfs
$ ../tools/dfs2sdf.pl gspls_m2_L10_n10_k1_t3_DFS.txt
$ sdf2png.sh
```

## APPENDIX
### gSpan DFS (Depth First Search) format
Letâ€™s begin with the following simple example, which stands `C-C`.

`(6) 1 (0f6)`

The first `(6)` stands for the atom label (`6` means Carbon). `1 (0f6)` means that there exists a forward edge from the atom index `0` to the next atom labeled `6`, with bond label `1` (single bond). It then from a single chemical structure `C-C`. The atom indices are automatically given by the order of their appearance, and starts with `0`.
The next example stands for `C-C=C-C=C-C=`, where the last bond is connected to the first atom, and compose a ring structure.

`(6) 1 (0f6) 2 (1f6) 1 (2f6) 2 (3f6) 1 (4f6) 2 (b0)`

`2 (b0)`at the end of the string means that there exists a double bond from the current atom to the 1st atom (index `0`). This bond is named as backward edge. Only backward edge makes circular structure, or cyclic graphs.
